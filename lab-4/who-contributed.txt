To find the first commit, I used the command 

$ git log --max-parents=0

The first commit had an ID of 68b02c7b1464af59ca5f17c38b33d8afe781ce3b. The script I used to test if the commit is "good" or "bad" was the following: 

------------------
#!/bin/bash

! grep -rq "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information." /Users/sophiasharif/Desktop/projects/tz

exit $?
------------------

If grep finds a match, it will have a exit status of 0; however, this is bad commit, so we want and exit status of 1. This is why I put the "!" in front of the grep.  After writing this script, I ran:

$ git bisect start HEAD 68b02c7b1464af59ca5f17c38b33d8afe781ce3b
$ git bisect run ../project-4/check_line.sh

This outputted a commit with the ID c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b. I ran:

$ git checkout c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b
$ grep -r "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information." .

And found that the line is in the "northamerica" file. Here is where it was introduced:

# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
# Indiana generally observes either EST all year, or CST/CDT,
# but areas near Cincinnati and Louisville use those cities' timekeeping
# and in 1969 and 1970 the whole state observed daylight time;
# and there are other exceptions as noted below.
# Shanks partitions Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
# and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.

We can see that the author is quoting the line and citing the original source, so this is not plagiarism.
