Using the command 

$ git log --grep="git merge-tree" v2.38.5..v2.39.3 

I found that the original commit that contained the message in the assignment was the following:

-----------------------------------------------
commit 19118cb8570e499e1a56e81740cee3d1c1206b44

    Merge branch 'js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo'
    
    In read-only repositories, "git merge-tree" tried to come up with a
    merge result tree object, which it failed (which is not wrong) and
    led to a segfault (which is bad), which has been corrected.
    
    * js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo:
      merge-ort: return early when failing to write a blob
      merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories
-----------------------------------------------

The line "* js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo" is a summary line that indicates that the branch was merged, and the two lines below are brief descriptions of individual commits that were included as part of the merge.  This told me that the commit that made the fix must have had "fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories" in its commit message.  So, I ran

$ git log --grep="fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories"

And found that the original commit, authored by Johannes Schindelin, was the following:

-----------------------------------------------
commit 0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc
Author: Johannes Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de>

    merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories
    
    If the blob/tree objects cannot be written, we really need the merge
    operations to fail, and not to continue (and then try to access the tree
    object which is however still set to `NULL`).
    
    Let's stop ignoring the return value of `write_object_file()` and
    `write_tree()` and set `clean = -1` in the error case.

To see the patches, I then ran

$ git show 0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc

This told me that the two files changed were "merge-ort.c" and "merge-tree-write-tree.sh". I ran the following command to generate the patch file:

$ git format-patch -1 0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc -o ~/CS35L/patch/
